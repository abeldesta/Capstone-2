# Introduction
## Data
I found a dataset on kaggle that contains most of the artwork from the 50 influential artist ranging from everytime period. The data came with a csv file that contains information about each artist, such as a small bio, genre and nationality of the artist. The artwork was scraped from [artchallenge](http://artchallenge.ru/?lang=en) website. There is around 8500 images scaped.
